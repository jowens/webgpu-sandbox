            <b>Why this is cool</b>: Connectivity (at all levels of subdivision)
            can be and is statically generated, but the subdivision is computed
            dynamically in a compute shader. Thus we can send a small coarse
            mesh from CPU to GPU, animate that coarse mesh on the CPU, and
            generate its more detailed subdivision entirely on the GPU. No one
            wants to animate a fine mesh.

          <li>
            These two surfaces don't look too similar, to be honest. That is
            typical though (level 0 and level 1 aren't super close to each
            other, and it's additionally possible there could be coding
            mistakes). The subdivided surface at level 1 should be the proper
            subdivision of the level-0 pyramid. If we kept subdividing, we would
            eventually get a smooth limit surface. Autodesk was

            that I'm roughly on the right track:

        What is the compute? The core of Catmull-Clark subdivision is three
        compute kernels, which iterate over (1) all faces (computing new "face
        points"), (2) all edges (computing new "edge points"), and (3) all
        vertices (computing new vertices as a function of old vertices and new
        face and edge points).
      </li>
      <li>
        Additionally, pyramid vertices are perturbed (as a function of vertex
        ID) in a compute shader, which iterates over all vertices. This is
        analogous to animating the base mesh on the CPU, as would occur in a
        game/simulation.
      </li>
      <li>Rendered as indexed triangles</li>
      <li>Toggle is implemented simply by binding a different index buffer</li>
      <li>Vertex colors are simply the vertex normal</li>
      <li>
        Camera is implemented in the vertex shader; it rotates around the
        pyramid. Camera code mostly swiped from

    <p>External includes that help make this work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://wgpu-matrix.org/docs/">wgpu-matrix</a> for
        modelview/projection matrix operations
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Things missing from WebGPU:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indexed quad rendering</li>
      <li>Hardware tessellation units (not sure on this, though)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What would be fun to write that I'm secretly hoping I get to write:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>More levels of subdivision</li>
      <li>
        Automatically generating all tables for that subdivision (in the CPU, at
        "compile time", but really at runtime when the program is launched)
      </li>
      <li>More interesting inputs than a pyramid</li>
      <li>
        The whole point of Niessner's formulation is it supports sharp creases.
        That's currently ignored in the implementation; the implementation
        generates a smooth limit surface. But real subdivision surfaces may have
        sharp edges and/or vertices.
      </li>
      <li>Adaptive subdivision (subdividing only where necessary)</li>
      <li>Integrating a prefix-sum for the valence-offset tables</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What could make this visually better:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Actual lighting (we do have normal vectors per vertex)</li>
      <li>

          >Wireframe</a

        that shows the underlying mesh
      </li>
      <li>Better choice of parameters that generates a smooth animation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What could make the (nonexistent) UI better:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      <li>
        Setting simulation parameters in the UI rather than ~hardcoded in the
        code
      </li>
